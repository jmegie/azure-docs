# Conditional Access: Block access by location

With the location condition in Conditional Access, you can control access to your cloud apps based on the network location of a user. The location condition is commonly used to block access from countries/regions where your organization knows traffic shouldn't come from. For more information about IPv6 support, see the article [IPv6 support in Azure Active Directory](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/azure-ad-ipv6-support).

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access policies are enforced after first-factor authentication is completed. Conditional Access isn't intended to be an organization's first line of defense for scenarios like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, but it can use signals from these events to determine access.

## Define locations

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** as a Conditional Access Administrator, Security Administrator, or Global Administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access** > **Named locations**.
1. Choose **New location**.
1. Give your location a name.
1. Choose **IP ranges** if you know the specific externally accessible IPv4 address ranges that make up that location or **Countries/Regions**.
   1. Provide the **IP ranges** or select the **Countries/Regions** for the location you're specifying.
      * If you choose Countries/Regions, you can optionally choose to include unknown areas.
1. Choose **Save**

More information about the location condition in Conditional Access can be found in the article, 
[What is the location condition in Azure Active Directory Conditional Access](location-condition.md)

## Create a Conditional Access policy

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** as a Conditional Access Administrator, Security Administrator, or Global Administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
1. Under **Cloud apps or actions** > **Include**, and select **All cloud apps**.
1. Under **Conditions** > **Location**.
   1. Set **Configure** to **Yes**
   1. Under **Include**, select **Selected locations**
   1. Select the blocked location you created for your organization.
   1. Click **Select**.
1. Under **Access controls** > select **Block Access**, and click **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After confirming your settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), an administrator can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.
