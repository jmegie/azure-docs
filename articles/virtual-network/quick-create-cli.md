# Quickstart: Use Azure CLI to create a virtual network

This quickstart shows you how to create a virtual network by using Azure CLI, the Azure command-line interface. You then create two virtual machines (VMs) in the network, securely connect to the VMs from the internet, and communicate privately between the VMs.

A virtual network is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. Azure Virtual Network enables Azure resources like VMs to securely communicate with each other and the internet.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. You can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- Azure Cloud Shell or Azure CLI.

  The steps in this quickstart run the Azure CLI commands interactively in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview). To run the commands in the Cloud Shell, select **Open Cloudshell** at the upper-right corner of a code block. Select **Copy** to copy the code, and paste it into Cloud Shell to run it. You can also run the Cloud Shell from within the Azure portal.

  You can also [install Azure CLI locally](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to run the commands. The steps in this article require Azure CLI version 2.0.28 or later. Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find your installed version and dependent libraries, and run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade) to upgrade.

  If you use a local installation, sign in to Azure by using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command.

## Create a virtual network and subnet

1. First, use [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) to create a resource group to host the virtual network. Run the following code to create a resource group named `TestRG` in the `eastus` Azure region.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az group create \
     --name TestRG \
     --location eastus
   ```

1. Use [az network vnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet#az-network-vnet-create) to create a virtual network named `VNet` with a subnet named `default` in the `TestRG` resource group.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az network vnet create \
     --name VNet \
     --resource-group TestRG \
     --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
     --subnet-name default \
     --subnet-prefixes 10.0.0.0/24
   ```

## Deploy Azure Bastion

Azure Bastion uses your browser to connect to VMs in your virtual network over secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) by using their private IP addresses. The VMs don't need public IP addresses, client software, or special configuration. For more information about Azure Bastion, see [Azure Bastion](~/articles/bastion/bastion-overview.md).

1. Use [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#az-network-vnet-subnet-create) to create an Azure Bastion subnet for your virtual network. This subnet is reserved exclusively for Azure Bastion resources and must be named `AzureBastionSubnet`.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az network vnet subnet create \
     --name AzureBastionSubnet \
     --resource-group TestRG \
     --vnet-name VNet \
     --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/26 \
     --location eastus
   ```

1. Create a public IP address for Azure Bastion. The bastion host uses the public IP to access secure shell (SSH) and remote desktop protocol (RDP) over port 443.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az network public-ip create --resource-group TestRG --name VNet-ip --sku Standard --location eastus
   ```

1. Use [az network bastion create](/cli/azure/network/bastion#az-network-bastion-create) to create an Azure Bastion host in the AzureBastionSubnet of your virtual network.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az network bastion create \
     --name VNet-bastion \
     --public-ip-address VNet-ip \
     --resource-group TestRG \
     --vnet-name VNet --location eastus
   ```

It takes about 10 minutes for the Bastion resources to deploy. You can create VMs in the next section while Bastion deploys to your virtual network.

## Create virtual machines

Use [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create) to create two VMs named `VM1` and `VM2` in the `default` subnet of the virtual network. When you're prompted for credentials, enter user names and passwords for the VMs.

1. To create the first VM, run the following command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm create \
     --resource-group TestRG \
     --name VM1 \
     --image Win2019Datacenter
   ```

1. To create the second VM, run the following command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm create \
     --resource-group TestRG \
     --name VM2 \
     --image Win2019Datacenter
   ```

>[!TIP]
>You can also use the `--no-wait` option to create a VM in the background while you continue with other tasks.

The VMs take a few minutes to create. After Azure creates each VM, Azure CLI returns output similar to the following message:

```output
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/CreateVNetQS-rg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VM2",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.5",
  "publicIpAddress": "40.68.254.142",
  "resourceGroup": "TestRG"
  "zones": ""
}
```

>[!NOTE]
>VMs in a virtual network with a Bastion host don't need public IP addresses. Bastion provides the public IP, and the VMs use private IPs to communicate within the network. You can remove the public IPs from any VMs in Bastion-hosted virtual networks. For more information, see [Dissociate a public IP address from an Azure VM](ip-services/remove-public-ip-address-vm.md).

## Connect to a VM

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Virtual machines**.

1. On the **Virtual machines** page, select **VM1**.

1. At the top of the **VM1** page, select **Connect**.

1. On the **Connect** page, select **More ways to connect**, and then select **Go to Bastion**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quick-create-portal/connect-to-virtual-machine.png" alt-text="Screenshot of connecting to VM1 with Azure Bastion." border="true":::

1. On the **Bastion** page, enter the username and password you created for the VM, and then select **Connect**.

## Communicate between VMs

1. From the desktop of VM1, open a command prompt and enter `ping myVM2`. You get a reply similar to the following message:

   ```cmd
   C:\windows\system32>ping VM2
   
   Pinging VM2.ovvzzdcazhbu5iczfvonhg2zrb.bx.internal.cloudapp.net with 32 bytes of data:
   Request timed out.
   Request timed out.
   Request timed out.
   Request timed out.
   
   Ping statistics for 10.0.0.5:
       Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss),
   ```

   The ping fails because it uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). By default, ICMP isn't allowed through Windows firewall.

1. To allow ICMP to inbound through Windows firewall on this VM, enter the following command:

   ```cmd
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="ICMP Allow incoming V4 echo request" protocol=icmpv4:8,any dir=in action=allow
   ```

1. Close the remote desktop connection to VM1.

1. Repeat the steps in [Connect to a VM](#connect-to-a-vm) to connect to VM2.

1. On VM2, from a command prompt, enter `ping VM1`.

   This time you get a success reply similar to the following message, because you allowed ICMP through the firewall on VM1.

   ```cmd
   C:\windows\system32>ping VM1
   
   Pinging VM1.e5p2dibbrqtejhq04lqrusvd4g.bx.internal.cloudapp.net [10.0.0.4] with 32 bytes of data:
   Reply from 10.0.0.4: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.0.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.0.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
   Reply from 10.0.0.4: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128
   
   Ping statistics for 10.0.0.4:
       Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
   Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
       Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 2ms, Average = 0ms
   ```

1. Close the remote desktop connection to VM2.

## Clean up resources

When you're done with the virtual network and the VMs, use [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) to remove the resource group and all its resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete \
    --name TestRG \
    --yes
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a virtual network with a default subnet that contains two VMs. You deployed Azure Bastion and used it to connect to the VMs, and securely communicated between the VMs. To learn more about virtual network settings, see [Create, change, or delete a virtual network](manage-virtual-network.md).

Private communication between VMs in a virtual network is unrestricted by default. Continue to the next article to learn more about configuring different types of VM network communications.
